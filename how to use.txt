This is a mini project to play Wordle (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle)

Setup Phase
-----------
It starts with a unversal english pool of words (hopefully exhaustive, based on the library used)
By reduction method, it will gradually reduce the pool of viable words, cumulatively.

Starting Phase
--------------
Suggest a word (to maximise clues, don't repeat letter) 
- get_n_letter_words(wordlist, length)
- get_filtered_words_no_letter_repeat(wordlist)
- randomly draw one from the resultant wordlist

No Clue Phase
-------------
Bad luck? You could still reduce by exclusion of used letters. Put those letters under 'excluded letters'
- filtered_words_excluding_letters(wordlist, excluded_letters)
- randomly draw one from the resultant wordlist

Mid-game: Some clues Phase (Rinse and repeat)
---------------------------------------------
First, reduce the pool of words by known letters (known or unknown position is fine) and most recent excluded letters.
- filtered_words_containing_letters(wordlist, included_letters)
- filtered_words_excluding_letters(wordlist, excluded_letters)

Secondly, reduce the pool of words by known letters at known position
- filtered_words_positional_letters(wordlist, positional_string) where positional_string can be '--llo'

Rinse and repeat until you get the answer.
